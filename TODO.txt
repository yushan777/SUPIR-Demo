Add arg --skip_1st_stage to skipe the VAE encode/denoise/decode stage that's 
designed to smooth out rough artefacts from crappy low resolution images before 
the main sampling stage. 

If image quality is already high, then this stage can be skipped, or maybe you prefer to denoise or soften your image manually or with other tools.
